## üí° Tips

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Names and expense types are case-sensitive
2. **Date Format**: Always use DD/MM/YYYY format for dates
3. **Numbers**: Use decimal point (.) for amounts, not comma (,)
4. **Consistency**: Make sure all names and types match exactly across files
5. **Exceptions**: Use exceptions file to set reduced participation rates for specific expense types (0.0-0.99)
6. **Shared types**: Use shared expense types for equal splits regardless of absences/exceptions
7. **Absences**: If you don't have an absences file, everyone is assumed present for all days
