# House Expense Calculator - Example Files

**Format:** CSV file with exactly 5 columns in this order:
- **Type**: Category of expense (must match your expense types list)
- **Reason**: Description of the expense
- **Date**: Date in DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g., 15/01/2025)
- **Amount**: Numeric amount (e.g., 85.50)
- **Person**: Name of person who paid (must match your people list)

### 2. `absences_example.csv` (Optional)
**Format:** CSV file with exactly 2 columns:
- **Person**: Name of person (must match your people list)
- **Absent_Days**: Number of days absent during the period (0 or positive integer)

### 3. `people_list_example.txt`
**Format:** Plain text file with one name per line

- Names must exactly match those used in expenses and absences files

### 4. `expense_types_example.txt`
**Format:** Plain text file with one expense type per line

### 5. `exceptions_example.csv` (Optional)

- **Purpose**: Allows certain people to opt out of specific expense categories (e.g., Bob doesn't pay for alcohol)

## üí° Tips

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Names and expense types are case-sensitive
2. **Date Format**: Always use DD/MM/YYYY format for dates
3. **Numbers**: Use decimal point (.) for amounts, not comma (,)
4. **Consistency**: Make sure all names and types match exactly across files
5. **Exceptions**: Use exceptions file to exclude people from specific expense types
6. **Absences**: If you don't have an absences file, everyone is assumed present for all days

- **üè∑Ô∏è Type mismatch**: Expense type in expenses not in types list  
- **‚ùå Missing people**: Person in people list missing from absences file
